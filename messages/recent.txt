0.5.x:
------

  Added highlighting of JS expressions where appropriate

  IMPORTANT:
  The package is now officially renamed to Ngx HTML. Remember to update relevant configs!
  
  For those who followed the readme and use ApplySyntax plugin,
  you should now change it to:
  
  ```
  "syntaxes": [
    {
        "syntax": "Ngx HTML/NgxHTML",
        "extensions": ["component.html"],
    },
  ]
  ```
