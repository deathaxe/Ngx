## How to use

The syntax is listed as Ngx HTML in Sublime syntax selection list.

I personaly use ApplySyntax plugin with the following setting:

"syntaxes": [
    {
        "syntax": "Angular2 HTML Syntax/Angular2HTML",
        "extensions": ["component.html"],
    },
]

You could use it in other ways...
e.g. set it as the default syntax for all html files,
since it's a superset of the html syntax anyway.

Note: the package will eventually be renamed to "Ngx HTML" to be
consistent with the already renamed syntax name.
When the time comes, you'd want to change the syntax name in
ApplySyntax setting to "Ngx HTML/NgxHTML"...
